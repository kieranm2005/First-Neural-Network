# First-Neural-Network

First-Neural-Network.py - Neural network built in python not using any ML libraries like Keras, Pytorch etc. Following Tariq Rashid's book Make Your Own Neural Network.

First-Keras-Network.py - Neural network built using Keras, following Jason Brownlee's tutorial.

Keras-Initials.py - Neural network trained to identify handwritten letters A-Z.

First-Pytorch-Network.py - Neural network built using Pytorch. Implementing the same as Keras-Initials.py
