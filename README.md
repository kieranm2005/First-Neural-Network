# First-Neural-Network

First-Neural-Network.py - Neural network built in python not using any ML libraries like Keras, Pytorch etc. Following Tariq Rashid's book Make Your Own Neural Network.

First-Keras-Network.py - Neural network built using Keras, following Jason Brownlee's tutorial.

Keras-Initials.py - Neural network trained to identify handwritten letters A-Z.

First-Pytorch-Network.py - Neural network built using Pytorch. Implementing the same as Keras-Initials.py

## Snntorch tutorial stuff

Snntorch-Spike-Encoding.py - Following Tutorial 1 - Spike Encoding from the Snntorch docs

Snntorch-Leaky-Integrate-Fire-Neuron.py - Following Tutorial 2 - The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron from the Snntorch docs

## Snntorch misc

CSNN-Expansion.py - Convolutional-SNN.py with a learning rate scheduler

To do:
- Add individual files based off of First-Neural-Network.py for XOR function, vertical/horizontal line classification
